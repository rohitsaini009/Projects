In this project, we delve into a dataset encapsulating various health metrics from __heart patients__,
including age, blood pressure, heart rate, and more. 
Our goal is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately identifying individuals with heart disease.
Given the grave implications of missing a positive diagnosis,
our primary emphasis is on ensuring that the model identifies all potential patients,
making recall for the positive class a crucial metric.
